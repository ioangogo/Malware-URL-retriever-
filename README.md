# Malware-URL-retriever-
In a lot of spam emails they get you to download documents that contain macros, these macros include code to hide the download url in the array and to run it and to make the doument look legit. This scripts allows you to Decode the URL and output the address quickly
#Usage
## How do i put the array in
Doc files use VBA scripts to do macros, so you will need to find the array in the document, get the stuff in the ```array()``` command and put it in to a txt file, then use find and replace to replase ```, ``` with ```\n```.

This txt file has to be using a unix line separation as the Platform the script was made on is unix based

## The program is asking me questions
Yeah, sorry, when creating this program for my own purposise I noticed the simple math used in the ```GetStringFrom Array()``` was changing time to time so i decided to ask the user to check this them selfs by finding the ```GetStringFrom Array()``` function in the VBA source and checking the code to see what the function looked like
```VBScript
Public Function GetStringFromArray(fromArr() As Variant, LenLen As Integer) As String
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim result As String
    result = ""
    For i = LBound(fromArr) To UBound(fromArr)
        result = result & Chr(fromArr(i) - LenLen + i * 2)
    Next i
    GetStringFromArray = result
End Function
```
as the spammers might remove the ```*2``` or remove it so thats why it asked the 2 questions ```Times(0) or no times(1): ``` and ```Times By What? ```
